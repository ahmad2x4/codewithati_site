Hello, my name is Ahmad Atighechi. People also call me Ati. I am a full stack developer and a consultant. I used to blog in [www.ahmadreza.com](https://ahmadreza.com). Not very often, though. My first post there goes back to 2008. However, during the past 12 years, I had only posted a few blog posts. I have been recently thinking about this: why I had not frequently been posting, and I had found a few reasons. The main reason is that I had been trying to publish only the technical (programming related) blog post to my personal blog. I guess I should not limit myself on that website to only post technical blog post. Instead, I'd rather post anything interesting in my life in [www.ahmadreza.com](https://ahmadreza.com) rather than limiting myself to programming related post only.

On the other hand, I really like to blog about coding experiences and challenges I face in different projects and share with everyone. So, I decided to create this website (Code With Ati) for the tech-related blog posts. It doesn't mean I am not going to post a technical blog post in my personal blog, but it means I will not limit myself to only technical blog posts there.
I also decided to take this to a new level and add other mediums as well, like youtube and twitch. I think many people prefer to watch a video than reading a blog post, and I believe there are both media have their own audiences. 
This is a new beginning for my technical blogging and vlogging journey. I hope having a separate website would help me to post more here and also on my own personal website. I look forward to getting feedback from you to see what topic you want me to explore more make videos or stream on twitch. 

So stay tuned and subscribe to my channel for future content. Thanks.
